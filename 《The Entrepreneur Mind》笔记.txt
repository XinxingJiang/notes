In The Entrepreneur Mind I detail how elite entrepreneurs respond quickly, put their business first, consult with mentors often, hire the best team, create an environment of stressful urgency, use time wisely, and so on.

While most people seek refuge, entrepreneurs take risks.

Their goal isn’t to think outside the box as much as it is to own the box.

All entrepreneurs must ask themselves three vital questions that concern their business strategy: Where are we now? Where do we want to be? How do we get there?

Not failure, but low aim is sin.

A business can fail in two ways: not surviving beyond its start and not reaching its full potential.

In business, “thinking big” simply means pursuing ideas that maximize the scope of your potential.

Talk to as many people as you can. What you want are the people who will tell you what’s wrong with your idea. They are the ones you can learn from.
